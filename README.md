# Just a few guidelines to remember for our GitHub repo:

- Use your own dedicated branch: Always create and work in your own branch for any code changes. This keeps work organised and avoids conflicts.
- Sync regularly with dev: Frequently pull updates from the dev branch into your branch to stay current with the latest code. Especially do this before starting new changes in your branch to minimise merge conflicts.
- Test before pushing to dev: Ensure all your code works as expected before pushing to the dev branch. This includes running tests, checking for errors, and confirming functionality.
- No direct pushes to main: The main branch is protected. Only push changes to dev -never directly to main.


## REMEMBER TO ADD REGULAR COMMENTS THROUGHOUT YOUR CODE!
