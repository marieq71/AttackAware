            <h2 class="IoT-heading">What is <span class="highlight">IoT Device Hacking?</span></h2>
            <p>IoT (Internet of Things) device hacking refers to exploiting vulnerabilities in internet-connected devices to gain unauthorized access or control. IoT devices include everyday objects like smart home appliances, security cameras, wearable technology, and industrial equipment, all of which are connected to the internet and communicate with each other.</p>

            <h2 class="IoT-heading">How to prevent <span class="highlight">IoT Device Hacking?</span></h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Use Strong, Unique Passwords: Change default passwords on IoT devices to strong, unique passwords. Many devices come with weak or well-known default passwords, making them easy targets for attackers.</li>
                <li>Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA): Where available, use two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security, ensuring that even if a password is compromised, unauthorized access is still more difficult.</li>
                <li>Keep Firmware and Software Updated: Regularly update your IoT devices with the latest firmware and software patches. Manufacturers often release updates to fix security vulnerabilities, so keeping devices up-to-date can protect against newly discovered threats.</li>
                <li>Disable Unnecessary Features: Turn off features that are not in use, such as remote access or data sharing. These features can be potential entry points for attackers if left enabled.</li>
            </ul>

            </div>

            <ol>
                <li>Disconnect the Device Immediately: Disconnect the compromised IoT device from the internet or your home network to prevent the hacker from accessing it or using it for further attacks.</li>
                <li>Change Passwords: Change the passwords of the hacked device, your home router, and any associated accounts. Ensure the new passwords are strong and unique for each device and account. If the device has a default password, replace it right away.</li>
                <li>Update Firmware and Software: Check for any firmware or software updates for the compromised device. Manufacturers often release security patches to address vulnerabilities. Make sure all IoT devices are running the latest versions of their software.</li>
                <li>Reset the Device to Factory Settings: If the device has been severely compromised, perform a factory reset to remove any malware or unauthorized access. After the reset, set up the device again using secure settings and updated firmware.</li>
