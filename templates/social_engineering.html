            <ol>
                <li>Immediately Report the Incident: Notify your IT or security team right away. Prompt reporting can prevent further damage and help them assess the scope of the attack.</li>
                <li>Monitor for Unusual Activity: Closely monitor your financial accounts, emails, and any other affected systems for unusual activity, unauthorized access, or fraudulent transactions.</li>
                <li>Inform Your Contacts: If your email or social media accounts were compromised, alert your contacts. Warn them not to click on suspicious links or respond to unusual requests that might come from your compromised account.</li>
                <li>If possible, restore your data from a recent backup. This is why regular backups are crucial.</li>
                <li>Check Account Recovery for Suspicious Activity: Review the recovery options (e.g., backup emails, phone numbers) for all your important accounts. Attackers may try to change these details to maintain access. Secure any changes by re-verifying your recovery information.</li>
